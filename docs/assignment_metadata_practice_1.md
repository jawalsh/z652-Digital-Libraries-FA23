# Metadata and Functional Requirements Lab Part I
In this lab, we'll be practicing the following:
1. analyzing potential context, content, and users
2. creating functional requirements for a digital library
3. creating a MAP for metadata creation
4. following documentation to create metadata
5. creating good documentation

The lab itself has two parts which we'll accomplish over the next week. 
## Part I (in-class Sept. 15; due 11:59pm Sept. 18)
### Instructions
On Canvas, there's a folder in Files called "Metadata and Documentation Lab". Within it, there are two folders: "A Items" and "B Items". Consult the text file also in that folder to see whether you are in Group A or Group B. 

Each group has PDFs pages from 5 cookbooks. These items will serve as representative items from a collection of cookbooks that will form a hypothetical digital library. 

Take some time to examine these items. From these items, think about a potential context and users to go with the content for the hypothetical digital library of these items, then come up with some functional requirements for the digital library. 

From those functional requirements, decide on 6 metadata fields plus their cardinality, obligation, content guidelines, and mapping to Dublin Core. 

Then describe one of the items you have using this prototype metadata application profile (MAP) to serve as an example record. 

### What to turn in
- List which group you're in, but do not put your name on your paper!
- A title for the hypothetical digital library
- Brief (1-3 sentences) description of the context, users, and content.
- List of functional requirements
- Description of metadata fields with: 
    - cardinality
    - obligation
    - content guidelines
    - mapping to Dublin Core
    - notes (if necessary)
    - Optionally, you can link to controlled vocabularies (must include link to controlled vocabulary or list of items if it is a controlled vocabulary you design)
- 1 metadata record based on the metadata application profile. 

When you are finished, turn this prototype MAP into Canvas as Word, PDF, or Markdown file.

### Things to keep in mind
In the next step, you'll be trading prototype MAPs with a person from the other group. They will use your prototype MAP to create metadata for the items in your group's folder. 

Therefore, write and organize your MAP (aka, your documentation!) knowing that another person will be using it to create metadata! Use headings, lists, tables, etc. to make your documentation easy to navigate and read.
