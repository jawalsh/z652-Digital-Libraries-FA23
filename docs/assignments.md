## Lab Exercises
We we have a number of smaller activities and exercises, some of which will be turned in for credit. The activities and exercises submitted for credit will count towards your Lab Exercises points.

## Participation
Attendance and regular participation in our weekly class meetings and online discussions are required. In-class participation includes contributing to discussions, asking and answering questions, and actively engaging in individual and group activities. Participation in online discussions includes both your original posts and your responses to other students’ posts. Half of the 100 participation points will be calculated based on your attendance and participation in weekly class meetings. The other 50 points will be calculated based on your participation in online discussions.
